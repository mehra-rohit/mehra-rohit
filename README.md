Hi, I'm Rohit ðŸ‘‹ I'm a data scientist . 

ðŸ’» I build Big Data solutions for PocketFm using machine learning, causal inference and optimization models.  
ðŸ”­ I'm currently building Recommendation systems, content moderation systems and other goofy stuff.  
ðŸ˜… Fun fact: After completing my Bachelor's, I went to Ireland for Masters in Structural Engineering, my thesis involved implementation of AI. I got involved into Machine Learning so much, that I decided to pursue a career in it.  
  
I'm best reached via [email : work.rmehra@gmail.com]. I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
