Hi, I'm Rohit ðŸ‘‹ I'm a data scientist . 

ðŸ’» I build Big Data solutions for Glance (Inmobi Group) using machine learning, causal inference and optimization models.  
ðŸ”­ I'm currently building Ad-recommender engine.  
ðŸ˜… Fun fact: After completing Bachelor, I went to Ireland for Master's in Structural Engineering, where my thesis involved using AI. During my thesis, I got involved  
into Machine Learning so much I decided to pursue a career in it.
